    ## Auto-Save Your AI Conversations

    SpecStory automatically saves AI chat history in your project's `.specstory` folder. Each conversation is saved as a separate markdown file, ensuring you never lose valuable AI interactions.

    * **Auto-save is enabled by default** but can be disabled via the setting `specstory.autoSave`.

    * Works seamlessly in the background.

    * Preserves your entire conversation history.

    * Compatible with local and remote workspaces (SSH, DevContainers, WSL).

    ## Manual Save and Export

    Need more control over your saved conversations? Use the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `SpecStory: Save AI Chat History` to:

    * Select specific conversations to save.

    * Combine multiple conversations into a single markdown file.

    ## Share and Editorialize Your AI Conversations

    Share your AI chat history instantly using the command palette with `SpecStory: Share AI Chat History`.

    Key sharing features:

    * Get a unique, shareable URL instantly.

    * Share anonymously - no signup required.

    * Select specific conversations to include.

    * Add markdown and edit markdown blocks, images and embed videos into to your shares.

    * Add a GitHub URL to "link" your work together.

    * Edit or remove shared content later (cookie-based authentication).

    ## Automatically Derive Rules for AI

    In SpecStory [v0.7.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) and later you can turn on an feature via the setting `specstory.derivedRules`.

    <Info>
      To use this feature you must:

      * Have Auto-save enabled.

      * Create an account and sign-in to the Specstory extension.

      This feature is currently free. Each generation makes a call to an LLM and we require authentication to its prevent abuse.
    </Info>

    Key Features

    * Automatically create a `derived-rules.mdc` to `.cursor/rules` or `copilot-instructions.md` to `.github/`.

    * Back-ups your previous versions to the `.specstory/ai_rules_backups` directory.

    * Automatically adds backups to your `.gitignore`.

    * Allows for custom file headers to be modified to customize rule generation through settings.

    ## How Rules Derivation Works

    The system prompt currently in use is:

    ```
    You are an expert software engineer responsible for maintaining a "living" and "evolving" AI coding assistant rules file. This file defines all project rules, coding standards, workflow guidelines, references, documentation structures, and best practices. Each time you receive new user–AI interactions, you must merge any relevant new guidelines, clarifications, or decisions into the file which is stored in the root of the project and is obeyed by the AI coding assistant.

    Rules for Updating:

    1. Retain the structure of the AI coding assistant rules file, which uses the following top-level sections:
    <headers/>

    2. Read the new user–AI interactions carefully. Identify any instructions, new rules, clarifications, or best practices that arise. Incorporate them into the correct sections. If a new rule conflicts with an existing one, note the conflict and either:
       - Resolve it by clarifying the final, decided rule,
       - OR highlight that further user confirmation is needed.

    3. Do not remove or discard existing content unless there is a clear directive to do so, but if a new rule supersedes or modifies old content, replace or annotate the old content accordingly. Don't let the rule file grow too much.

    4. Maintain consistent markdown format, with ## headings for the top-level structure.

    5. If version updates or references to version changes arise record them under the relevant section(s). For example, if it impacts the "TECH STACK" or "PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM", note it there.

    6. If any mention of new coding tools or libraries arises, add them under the correct section (e.g., "TECH STACK") but do not remove previous entries.

    7. If new debugging or workflow rules appear in the saved chat as a result of a user request to the AI, insert them into the correct sections (e.g., "DEBUGGING" or "WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES").

    8. Look for signals that the user's intent is to make something a permanent rule. This includes words like "don't","must", "should", "always", "never", "all the time", "every time", "every time you see this", etc.

    9. Don't make ANY adjustments to the AI coding assistant rules file unless you are absolutely sure that the user's intent is rule like in nature. Err on the side of making too few adjustments, not too many. It's perfectly fine to leave the file as it is.

    10. After merging all relevant updates, output the entire updated AI coding assistant rules file as a single cohesive markdown document. Do not include extraneous commentary or placeholders, just the final updated file content.

    ---

    TASK: Please merge the new interactions into the AI coding assistant rules file as specified, and return the complete updated file content in markdown format. Ensure all headings remain in order, conflicts are addressed, and the file remains consistent and comprehensive.

    OUTPUT FORMAT:

    You must return the updated AI coding assistant rules file as a single cohesive markdown document. Do not include extraneous commentary.

    You must return the response inside a <rules-file> tag. Example:

    <rules-file>
    Content of the updated AI coding assistant rules file
    </rules-file>

    The MOST IMPORTANT THING is that you must return the response inside a <rules-file> tag.

    After installing, run the wrapper and it will start claude code.
    ```bash
    ## By default, specstory launches Claude Code with any additional provided arguments.
    specstory 

    ## Use -h to see help for all available options
    specstory -h
    ```

    ## Auto-Save Your AI Conversations

    SpecStory CLI wrapper automatically captures your Claude Code conversations when you run it. Sessions are saved as markdown files in `.specstory/history/` in your current project directory.

    * **Automatic capture** when running `specstory` (launches Claude Code with session tracking).

    * Sessions are saved with timestamps and descriptive filenames.

    * Preserves complete conversation history including code blocks and outputs.

    * Markdown files are immediately available for version control or sharing.

    ## Export and Organize Conversations

    Simple flags let you manage your Claude Code conversation history:

    ```bash
    # Sync all Claude Code sessions to markdown
    specstory -s

    # Convert a specific session to markdown
    specstory -u <session-uuid>

    # See what's happening with verbose output
    specstory -s --verbose
    ```

    The wrapper reads Claude Code's session files from `~/.claude/projects/` and converts them to clean markdown in your project's `.specstory/history/` directory.

    ## Share Your AI Conversations

    The current CLI wrapper focuses on markdown generation. Your conversations are saved locally and can be shared through:

    * **Git commits** - Add `.specstory/history/` to version control
    * **Direct file sharing** - Send markdown files to teammates
    * **Documentation** - Include conversations in project docs
    * **Manual upload** - Use any markdown hosting service

    <Info>
      Direct sharing to share.specstory.com is currently available in VS Code/Cursor extensions. CLI sharing features are on the roadmap!
    </Info>

    ## Conversation History as Documentation

    The SpecStory CLI wrapper transforms your Claude Code sessions into valuable documentation:

    * **Learning resource** - Review past problem-solving approaches
    * **Knowledge base** - Search through markdown files for solutions
    * **Team sharing** - Commit conversations for team learning
    * **Project context** - Build up domain knowledge over time


    The generated markdown files include:

    * Complete conversation threads with context

    * Code blocks with syntax highlighting

    * Timestamps and session metadata

    * Clean formatting for easy reading
