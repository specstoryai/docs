    ## Automatic autosave

    When you install SpecStory, it runs quietly in the background and saves your AI chat history for the active project inside `.specstory/history/`. You can toggle autosave at any time in [settings](/specstory/settings).

    </Frame>

    ## Capture specific chats on demand

    Want to bundle selected conversations into a single file? Open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `SpecStory: Save AI Chat History`.

    <Frame>
      ![Never lose your chat history](https://share.specstory.com/extension/never_lose_your_composer_history_2.gif)
    </Frame>

    - Save curated conversations into one Markdown document.
    - The file opens immediately so you can review or edit before saving.
    - Commit the resulting Markdown alongside your code for a complete record.

    ## Publish a shareable link

    Share a conversation by running `SpecStory: Share AI Chat History` from the command palette.

    <Frame>
      ![share your chat history](https://share.specstory.com/extension/share_your_history_2.gif)
    </Frame>

    - Generate a private URL without creating an account.
    - Add descriptions, images, and additional Markdown sections before publishing.
    - Email [support@specstory.com](mailto:support@specstory.com) with the link if you ever need us to remove a shared conversation.

    ## Derive rules for AI automatically

    <Info>
      Rule derivation launched in SpecStory [v0.7.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) for Cursor and expanded to GitHub Copilot in `v0.11.0`. To enable it, turn on autosave and sign in to the SpecStory extension.
    </Info>

    Not familiar with AI rules?

    - GitHub Copilot [custom instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
    - Cursor [project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended) or [Cursor101.com](https://cursor101.com/cursor/rules)

    SpecStory analyzes your conversations to capture:

    - The level of detail you typically request from AI responses.
    - Any rule or header structure you rely on when guiding the model.
    - How you iterate between suggestions and code edits.
    - Architectural patterns that repeatedly surface in your prompts.

    The extension then writes out editor-specific rules in the appropriate locations:

    1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
    2. `.cursor/rules/derived-rules.mdc`

    ### Prompt headers

    SpecStory relies on consistent headers to generate high-quality rules. We include a default template informed by community best practices.

    </Frame>

    ### Benefits

    - Spend less time re-explaining preferences in every prompt.
    - Get faster, more aligned suggestions from Copilot and Cursor.
    - Let project rules evolve automatically as conversations provide new guidance.
