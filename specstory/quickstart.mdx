    <Info>
      This is a feature that launched in SpecStory [v0.7.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) for Cursor. It is updated to support both Copilot and Cursor in `v0.11.0`. Unlike all of the above features, it's use requires you to:

      - Have Auto-save enabled.
      - Create an account and sign-in to the SpecStory extension.
    </Info>
    - **❓ Unfamiliar with what rules for AI are?** Consult their respective docs:
      - Copilot [custom instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
      - Cursor [project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended) _or_ [Cursor101.com](https://cursor101.com/cursor/rules)_._

    There isn't a palette command for this one. When you chat with AI, SpecStory is like a mystical scribe in the corner, quill poised, noting patterns in:

    - **🧠 Your thinking style:** Do you prefer step-by-step explanations or quick solutions?
    - **🖋️ Your rule file headers:** Those special incantations you set the structure of your derived file with.
    - **🔄 Your iteration cycles:** How you refine code and conversation together with AI.
    - **🏗️ Your project structure:** The architecture of your digital temple.

    Then—abracadabra\!—SpecStory transmutes these observations into editor specific rules for AI. Stored in either:

    1. the `.github/` directory as `copilot-instructions.md`
    2. the `.cursor/rules` directory as `derived-rules.mdc`.

    **🌈 Prompt Headers: The Secret Ingredient**

    SpecStory needs your rule file headers to brew the perfect rules. To start you off, we've crafted a default based on distilled knowledge from the community of what tends to work best.

    **🌟 The Benefits of this Sorcery**

    - **🧙‍♀️ Less repetitive incantations:** Reduced need to constantly explain your preferences every time.
    - **⚡ Faster spell-casting:** AI responses align with your project from the start.
    - **🔄 Self-improving magic:** As you work, the rules evolve to match your growing expertise.

    ## 🪄 Your work saves itself, no cloud required\!

    When you run Claude Code through SpecStory, it automatically saves your conversations in `.specstory/history/` in your current project directory. The CLI acts as a wrapper, launching Claude Code while capturing all your chat sessions.

    ## 🎯 Save and organize your conversations

    SpecStory provides simple flags to manage your Claude Code conversations:

    ```bash
    # Run Claude Code through SpecStory wrapper (default)
    specstory run
    
    # Sync all Claude Code sessions to markdown files
    specstory sync
    
    # Generate markdown for a specific session
    specstory sync -u <session-uuid>
    
    # See what's happening with log output to the console
    specstory sync --console
    
    # Run Claude Code with a custom output directory
    specstory run --output-dir ~/my-claude-sessions
    ```

    - **📝 Automatic capture:** Running `specstory` launches Claude Code and captures conversations
    - **🗂️ Project-based organization:** Sessions are saved in `.specstory/history/` with timestamps
    - **💾 Batch conversion:** Use `-s` flag to convert all existing sessions to markdown
    - **🌳 Git-friendly:** All output is clean markdown, perfect for version control

    ## 🌟 Share your history with a story\!

    Currently, the SpecStory CLI wrapper focuses on capturing and converting your Claude Code sessions to markdown. Sharing features are on the roadmap\!

    For now, you can:

    - Generate markdown files with `specstory sync`
    - Find your conversations in `.specstory/history/`
    - Share the markdown files directly or through your preferred method
    - Commit them to git for team collaboration

    <Info>
      The VS Code and Cursor extensions have built-in sharing to share.specstory.com. Similar functionality for the CLI is coming soon\!

    ## 🧪 Auto-magically derive Rules for AI

    <Info>
      Rule derivation is currently available in the VS Code and Cursor extensions. The CLI wrapper focuses on session capture and markdown generation.
    </Info>
    While the CLI doesn't generate rules directly, your captured markdown sessions can be:

    - Analyzed manually to identify patterns
    - Used as context when crafting your own rules in (`claude.md`)
    - Shared with team members to establish coding conventions

    <Tip>
      The markdown files generated by `specstory sync` provide a complete history of your Claude Code interactions, making it easy to review and extract best practices.
