## Multiplatform support is now here

<Note>
  The SpecStory Extension [(changelog)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) supports both [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). For [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), we offer a CLI wrapper ([changelog](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases)) that captures your sessions.
</Note>

SpecStory saves, organizes, and makes all your AI chats searchable in structured Markdown. Never lose a great solution, easily share interactions, and use conversation history to refine Copilot and Cursor with custom instructions and project rules.

## üç¶ Installation Options

Choose your installation method based on your IDE:

### Extensions for VSCode & Cursor

<Info>
  Our VSIX extension works with both VSCode (with GitHub Copilot) and Cursor. Install directly from the Extension Marketplace in your preferred editor.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VSCode + Copilot">
    1. Open VSCode with GitHub Copilot installed and activated.
    2. Search for **SpecStory** in the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-X).
    3. Click **Install**. Consult our [Changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) to make sure you're on the latest version.
    4. Once installed, SpecStory automatically saves your Copilot chats to the `.specstory` folder in your project.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    1. Open Cursor.
    2. Search for **SpecStory** in the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-X).
    3. Click **Install**. Consult our [Changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) to make sure you're on the latest version.
    4. Once installed, SpecStory automatically saves your Cursor chats to the `.specstory` folder in your project.

    <Warning>
      As a Cursor user, if you try to install from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecStory.specstory-vscode) website banner you might find yourself in a state where VSCode has SpecStory installed but Cursor doesn't. [It makes for a bad time](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues/8). No one wants that.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual VSIX Install">
    <Tip>
      The SpecStory extension's VSIX works seamlessly with both GitHub Copilot and Cursor. You'll need to install it separately in each environment.
    </Tip>
    1. Make sure you're on the latest version of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/changelog/label/copilot/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/changelog).
    2. Download our extension: [specstory-vscode-latest.vsix](https://static.specstory.com/vscode-extension/releases/specstory-vscode-latest.vsix)
    3. From either editor, pop open the Command Palette (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and choose `Extensions: Install from VSIX‚Ä¶`.
    4. To verify the installation, open the Command Palette again (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and type `SpecStory`. You should see the available commands show up.
