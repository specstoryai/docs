## We work where you do

We have extensions for Cursor, VSCode, and Claude Code as well as a macOS desktop app that let you easily embrace a spec driven development flow. Start from where you are today, and turn your prompts and vibe code into reusable specs and clean documentation.

Get started where you work:
* SpecStory Extension for [Claude Code](/specstory/introduction#claude-code), [Cursor](/specstory/introduction#cursor), and [VSCode](/specstory/introduction#copilot)


A focused SpecFlow-based editor for macOS built on top of Claude Code:
