## Plan First, Build Better

> "Plan first, act second. Every great building starts with a blueprint. Every successful software project starts with a plan."

**SpecFlow** is an open methodology that transforms how you build software with AI agents. Instead of vibe-driven development that leads to chaos, SpecFlow brings structure, clarity, and predictable results.

## The Problem with Unstructured AI Development

Without structure, building with AI agents often results in:
- **Misaligned outputs** that don't match your intent
- **Wasted time** on iterations that miss the mark  
- **Fragmented results** from uncoordinated efforts
- **Lost context** between different development phases

## The SpecFlow Solution

SpecFlow provides a clear 5-step process that turns intent into working software:

**Intent** ‚Üí **Roadmap** ‚Üí **Tasks** ‚Üí **Execute** ‚Üí **Refine**

This structured approach ensures every prompt, every task, and every output serves your goals through optimal human-AI collaboration.
