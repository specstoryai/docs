SpecStory Cloud helps you move from **individual capture** to **shared, searchable context** across your team.
This guide walks you through creating an account, syncing your first project, and running your first search.

## 1. Create your SpecStory Cloud account

- Go to [cloud.specstory.com](https://cloud.specstory.com).
- Sign up with your email or GitHub account.
- Verify your email and log in.
- One logged in, you’ll land on an empty dashboard until you sync a project.

Once logged in, you’ll see the Cloud Dashboard. It will be empty at first until you sync your histories and project.

<Info>
SpecStory is **local‑first**. Nothing is synced until you explicitly turn on sync on your machine.
</Info>


## 2. Ensure local capture is working


SpecStory Cloud builds on top of the local `.specstory/history/` your tools already write. Choose your setup and confirm you see Markdown files locally before enabling sync:


### **Cursor / VS Code + GitHub Copilot**: Install the SpecStory extension (VSIX build for Cloud beta).


[Download SpecStory VSIX](https://static.specstory.com/cloud-beta/specstory-vscode-0.19.0-prod.vsix)


To install from this file in **Cursor** or **VS Code**:


1. Download the `.vsix` file above.
2. Open your editor.
3. Open the Command Palette (`View → Command Palette` or `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`).
4. Search for **“Extensions: Install from VSIX…”**.
5. Select the downloaded file to complete installation.
6. Restart your editor.

Once installed, open any project folder, start an AI chat, and confirm that `.specstory/history/` appears in your repo with Markdown files.


### **Claude Code**: Install the SpecStory CLI and run Claude Code through it so sessions are captured locally.

[Download SpecStory CLI](https://static.specstory.com/cloud-beta/specstory)

```bash
chmod +x specstory
mv specstory /usr/local/bin/
specstory version
```

Run Claude Code through SpecStory:

```bash
specstory run # launches Claude Code and captures the session
specstory sync # converts existing sessions to Markdown
```

### **BearClaude (macOS)**: Use BearClaude to author specs and talk to Claude Code. It saves your sessions to `.specstory/history/` in the project you open.

<Tip>
If `.specstory/history/` isn’t present, complete a short AI conversation first. The first Markdown file is created on save/auto-save.
</Tip>


## 3. Authenticate your device for Cloud

Run once per machine to allow uploads from the CLI/extension:

```bash
specstory auth login
```

This opens a browser window to complete a secure login. Your device stores a token locally and future syncs use it automatically.

<Note>
Authentication enables sync, but **does not** upload anything by itself.
</Note>


## 4. Sync your first project

You control what (and when) to sync. Pick the path that matches your setup.

### A) From Cursor / VS Code extensions

1. Open the project folder that is already using SpecStory and also contains `.specstory/history/`.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **`SpecStory: Sync with Cloud`**.
3. Watch for the completion toast, then visit the Cloud dashboard to verify sessions appear.

### B) From the CLI (Claude Code or cross‑project)

```bash
# Sync all local sessions in the current repo/project
specstory sync

# Sync a single session by ID
specstory sync -u <session-uuid>
```

After sync, refresh [cloud.specstory.com](https://cloud.specstory.com), you should see the project and synced sessions.


## 5. Run your first search

1. Open [cloud.specstory.com](https://cloud.specstory.com) and use the search bar.
2. Use the search bar to query across your synced histories.
3. Apply filters:

   * **Projects** (multi‑select)
   * **Time Range**
4. Open a result to review the results.

Search combines keyword and semantic retrieval so you can quickly resurface reasoning, tradeoffs, or design threads.

<Tip>
Search runs across **all projects you’ve synced**, so it’s ideal for cross‑repo discovery.
</Tip>


## 6. Current scope of collaboration

SpecStory Cloud currently supports **single‑user**. Each developer can sync their own histories and search them centrally. Team workspaces, invitations, and role‑based access are on the roadmap.

What you can do today:
- Each teammate can sync their own `.specstory/history/` to Git for code‑adjacent review in PRs and docs.
- Sessions can be exported or shared manually if needed.


## Best practices

* **Start small with one repo**: Sync one project first and validate capture → sync → search before rolling out to all repos.
* **Be intentional about what you sync**: Version your `.specstory/history/` in Git and use Cloud for team-wide search.
* **Tag important sessions**: Improves later search and retrieval.


## Troubleshooting

* **No sessions appear after sync**

  * Confirm `.specstory/history/` exists and contains Markdown files.
  * Run `specstory auth login` again if your token expired.
  * Re‑run `specstory sync` from the project root.

* **Command Palette action missing** (Cursor/VS Code)

  * Verify the SpecStory extension is installed and enabled in that editor.
  * Restart the editor after installation.

* **CLI can’t find Claude Code sessions**

  * Ensure you launched Claude Code via `specstory run` so the wrapper can capture sessions.
  * Use `specstory sync` to convert existing session logs to Markdown.
