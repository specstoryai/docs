title: "Sync & Store"
---


Sync lets you move those conversation histories into the Cloud for centralized indexing and search.

## How Sync Works

1. **Local Capture:** Editors (Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, BearClaude) and the CLI (Claude Code) write Markdown histories into `.specstory/history/`.
2. **Authentication:** You run `specstory auth login` once per machine to link your device with Cloud.
3. **Manual Sync:** Sync is always explicit - run via the CLI or extension command.
4. **Session Upload:** The CLI or extension uploads sessions one by one. For full-project sync, the CLI scans `.specstory/history/` and calls the API for each session file.
5. **Storage:** Sessions are stored in Cloud as:
   - **Markdown** (clean, readable capture)
   - **Raw JSON** (original conversation data)
   - Both are preserved exactly as generated

<Info>
SpecStory Cloud never runs background uploads. Every sync requires explicit action from you.
</Info>

## Configuring Sync

### From Cursor or VS Code extensions

- Open your project folder (must contain `.specstory/history/`).
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`).
- Run **`SpecStory: Sync with Cloud`**.
- The extension authenticates, uploads session files, and shows a completion toast.

### From the CLI (Claude Code or cross-project)

```bash
# Authenticate device (run once)
specstory auth login

# Sync all local sessions in the current repo/project
specstory sync

# Sync a single session by ID
specstory sync -u <session-uuid>
```

<Note>
Full-project sync happens because the CLI loops through all Markdown files and uploads them one by one. The Cloud API itself handles sessions individually.
</Note>

## Verifying Your AI-conversations Sync

After running sync:

* Check the **CLI output** (or toast in extensions) for success.
* Refresh [cloud.specstory.com](https://cloud.specstory.com).
* You should see your project and sessions listed.
* Open a session to confirm content matches your local Markdown.
