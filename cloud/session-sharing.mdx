title: "Session Sharing"
---

Session sharing lets you create public links to your AI coding sessions. Share problem-solving approaches, explain architectural decisions, or document debugging workflows with teammates, blog readers, or the community.

## How Sharing Works

SpecStory Cloud uses a **persistent sharing model**. When you share a session, you create a live link to that session—not a static snapshot. New exchanges added to the session automatically appear in the shared version.

- **Share URL format**: `cloud.specstory.com/share/{sessionId}`
- **Public access**: Viewers can access shared sessions without authentication
- **Owner control**: You decide what's visible and can revoke access at any time

<Info>
  Shared sessions are read-only for viewers. Only you can edit, hide content, or delete the session.

## Sharing a Session

1. Open a session in [cloud.specstory.com](https://cloud.specstory.com).
2. Click the **Share** button in the session header.
3. In the share modal:
   - Toggle **Public/Private** to enable or disable sharing.
   - Copy the share link using the **Copy Link** button.
   - Optionally hide specific exchanges (see below).
   - Use **Preview as Viewer** to see exactly what viewers will see.

When sharing is enabled, the share link becomes active. Setting the session back to **Private** makes the link return a 404 page.

<Tip>
  Use "Preview as Viewer" before making a session public to verify hidden content is properly excluded.
</Tip>

## Controlling Content Visibility

Not every exchange needs to be public. You can selectively hide exchanges that contain sensitive information, tangential discussions, or content you don't want viewers to see.

### Hiding Exchanges

- Each exchange has a visibility toggle (eye icon).
- Click the toggle to hide an exchange from the shared view.
- Hidden exchanges remain visible to you but are excluded from the public view.
- The share modal shows a summary: "You've hidden X exchanges."

<Note>
  Hidden exchanges are never sent to the public endpoint, ensuring sensitive content stays private at the network level.
</Note>

### What You Can Edit

As the session owner, you can:

- **Edit the session title** — Provide a clearer name for shared context.
- **Edit exchange titles** — For each exchange, provide a custom title.
- **Hide/show exchanges** — Control which prompt-response pairs are visible.
- **Delete exchanges** — Remove exchanges entirely from the session.

## What Viewers See

When someone opens your shared session link, they see:

- **Session title** — The name you've given the session.
- **Project info** — A small icon and project name for context.
- **Author info** — Indicates who shared the session.
- **Visible exchanges** — Only exchanges you haven't hidden.
- **Table of contents** — Navigation through the session's exchanges.

Viewers cannot:

- Edit or delete content.
- See hidden exchanges.
- Access your other sessions or projects.
- Download the original session data.

## Privacy and Security

Session sharing is designed with privacy as a priority:

- **Opt-in only**: Sessions are private by default. Sharing requires explicit action.
- **Database-level filtering**: Hidden exchanges are excluded from database queries for the public endpoint—they never leave the server.
- **Revocable access**: Set a session back to Private at any time to disable the share link.
- **No account required for viewers**: Public links work without authentication, but viewers have read-only access.

<Info>
  The public share endpoint (`/api/v1/share/{sessionId}`) is separate from authenticated endpoints. It only returns sessions marked as public and excludes hidden exchanges from the response.

## One-Time Sync for Extension Users

If you don't have auto-sync enabled in the SpecStory Extension, you can still share sessions:

1. **Share** on a local session (Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P, `SpecStory: Share AI Chat History`)
2. SpecStory prompts you to log in if needed.
3. A **one-time sync** uploads just that session to the cloud.
4. The session becomes shareable without enabling global auto-sync.

To update a shared session, re-share it to trigger another one-time sync.
