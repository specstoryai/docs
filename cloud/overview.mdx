SpecStory Cloud turns your local `.specstory/history/` into a shared knowledge system for your team.
Locally, SpecStory captures the reasoning and decisions behind your code. With Cloud, you get seamless centralized search, sync, and sharing of those conversations across projects and teams.

## Why SpecStory Cloud exists

Local-first capture is great for individuals, but it leaves teams with challenges:

- **Scattered knowledge**: reasoning lives on individual machines.
- **Lost context**: onboarding or PR review requires digging through repos and commits.
- **No global search**: finding ‚Äúthat one conversation about auth migrations‚Äù is slow or impossible.
- **Fragile sharing**: copy-pasting Markdown or links doesn‚Äôt scale.

Cloud solves these problems by indexing your synced sessions in one place.

## What Cloud adds today

- **Centralized search** across all synced projects.
- **Organized storage** by project and time.
- **Private by default**, nothing uploads until you explicitly run sync.
- **Single-user workspaces** today, team collaboration features are on the roadmap..
- **API endpoints** for programmatic sync and search.

<Tip>
SpecStory Cloud is **opt-in**. You decide when to sync and what projects to include.
</Tip>

## How It Fits Together

1. **Local Capture:**  Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Claude Code CLI, and BearClaude auto-save conversations to `.specstory/history/`.
2. **Sync to Cloud:**  Run `specstory sync` (or the equivalent editor command). The CLI sends each session securely to Cloud. No background uploads without consent.
3. **Centralized Search & Access:**  Cloud indexes synced histories for fast search and filtering. Find past decisions and design threads in seconds.
4. **Team Collaboration:**  Workspaces let teams explore reasoning, reference decisions, and keep context alive in PRs and documentation.

<Tip>
SpecStory Cloud is designed to **complement**, not replace, your local setup. If you want to stay fully local, keep using the extensions and CLI without enabling sync.
</Tip>

## What you can do with Cloud

- üîç **Search across projects**: Full-text + semantic search, with filters for projects and time range.
- üë• **Collaborate with teams**: Share context in PRs, RFCs, or onboarding docs.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Integrate with CLI & API** to script syncs or query histories.
