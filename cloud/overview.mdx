SpecStory Cloud turns your local `.specstory/history/` into a shared knowledge system for your team.
Locally, SpecStory captures the reasoning and decisions behind your code. With Cloud, you get seamless centralized search, sync, and sharing of those conversations across projects and teams.

## Why SpecStory Cloud exists

Local-first capture is great for individuals, but it leaves teams with challenges:

- **Scattered knowledge**: reasoning lives on individual machines.
- **Lost context**: onboarding or PR review requires digging through repos and commits.
- **No global search**: finding ‚Äúthat one conversation about auth migrations‚Äù is slow or impossible.
- **Fragile sharing**: copy-pasting Markdown or links doesn‚Äôt scale.

Cloud addresses these gaps.

## What does Cloud add

- **Centralized search** across all synced projects.
- **Organized storage** by repo, project, tags, or time.
- **Private by default** since nothing syncs until you opt in.
- **Team-ready workspaces** with roles and permissions.
- **API and automation hooks** to integrate with CI, docs, or dashboards.

## How It Fits Together

1. **Local Tools:**  Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Claude Code CLI, and BearClaude auto-save conversations to `.specstory/history/`.

2. **Sync to Cloud:**  You choose what to sync (manual, scheduled, or per-project). Sync respects your privacy - no background uploads without consent.

3. **Centralized Search & Access:**  Cloud indexes synced histories for fast search and filtering. Find past decisions and design threads in seconds.

4. **Team Collaboration:**  Workspaces let teams explore reasoning, reference decisions, and keep context alive in PRs and documentation.

<Tip>
SpecStory Cloud is designed to **complement**, not replace, your local setup. If you want to stay fully local, keep using the extensions and CLI without enabling sync.

## What you can do with Cloud

- üîç **Search across projects**: Full-text + semantic search, with filters for repo, author, file path, or tags.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Organize knowledge**: Create collections, tag sessions, and group conversations by project or workspace.
- üë• **Collaborate with teams**: Share context in PRs, RFCs, or onboarding docs.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Automate with the CLI and API**: Run searches, export results, or wire SpecStory into your CI/CD.
