SpecStory Cloud turns your local `.specstory/history/` into a centralized, searchable knowledge system. Locally, SpecStory captures the reasoning and decisions behind your code. With Cloud, you can sync those reasoning and conversations to one place, making them easier to search, organize, and revisit.

## Why SpecStory Cloud exists

Local-first capture is great for individuals, but it leaves with certain challenges:

- **Scattered knowledge**: conversations and reasonings sit isolated on different machines.
- **Lost context**: onboarding or PR review requires digging through repos and commits.
- **No global search**: finding “that one conversation about auth migrations” is slow or impossible.
- **Fragile sharing**: passing around or copy-pasting Markdown files doesn’t scale.

Cloud solves these problems by indexing your synced sessions in one place.

## What Cloud adds today

- **Centralized search** across all synced projects.
- **Organized storage** by project and time.
- **Private by default**, nothing syncs until you explicitly run it.
- **Single-user workspaces** today, team collaboration features are on the roadmap..
- **API endpoints** for programmatic sync and search.

<Tip>
  SpecStory Cloud is **opt-in**. You decide when to sync and what projects to include.
</Tip>

## How It Fits Together

1. **Local Capture:**  Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI auto-save conversations to `.specstory/history/`.
2. **Sync to Cloud:**  Run `specstory sync` (or the equivalent editor command). The CLI sends each session securely to Cloud. No background uploads without consent.
3. **Centralized Search & Access:**  Cloud indexes synced histories for fast search and filtering. Find past decisions and design threads in seconds.
4. **Personal Knowledge Hub:**  You can now query across projects and repos in seconds, with context preserved.

<Tip>
  SpecStory Cloud is designed to **complement**, not replace, your local setup. If you want to stay fully local, keep using the extensions and CLI without enabling sync.
</Tip>

## What you can do with Cloud

- 🔍 **Search across projects**: Full-text + semantic search, with filters for projects and time range.
- ⚙️ **Integrate with CLI & API** to script syncs or query histories.
