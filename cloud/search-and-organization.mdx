SpecStory Cloud is built to help you **resurface decisions, reasoning, and context** quickly.
Once your histories are synced, Cloud indexes them for both **keyword search** and **semantic search** with fast retrieval and accuracy.

## Search Basics

- Use the **search bar** at the top of the Cloud dashboard.
- Results combine:
  - **Full-text search** (matches exact words and phrases)
  - **Semantic search** (finds related meaning, even if phrasing differs)

<Info>
Semantic search is powered by vector embeddings, so “auth login flow” will also find sessions about “sign-in routes” or “authentication screens”.
</Info>

## Filters

Search can be narrowed down and refined using the filter panel:

- **Projects**: Select one or more synced projects.
- **Time Range**: Focus results on a specific timeframe (like day-wise, week, or custom).

## Exploring Results

Each result shows:

- **Title**: Usually derived from the first prompt in the session.
- **Snippet**: Preview of matched content with highlights.
- **Metadata**: Project name, date, and file location if available.

Click a result to open the **full conversation** in context.

<Tip>
Cross-project search is powerful for rediscovering “that conversation about auth migrations” or “the refactor plan we discussed two months ago,” even if you don’t recall the exact repo.
</Tip>

## Organizing Knowledge

SpecStory Cloud automatically groups sessions:
- **Workspace structure**: Sessions are organized by project and sync source when uploaded.

<Tip>
Version important `.specstory/history/` files in Git alongside your code. Cloud makes them searchable, Git keeps them reviewable in PRs.
