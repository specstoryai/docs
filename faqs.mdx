  <Accordion title="What versions of Cursor do you support?">
    SpecStory is tested to work with every version after `0.43.5`!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it cost money to use SpecStory?">
    Nope. Today SpecStory is [free as in beer üç∫](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/620/what-is-the-difference-between-free-as-in-beer-and-free-as-in-speech). Enjoy!
  </Accordion>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will you support other AI Code IDEs?">
    We get this question a lot! Each [AI Code IDE](https://specstory.com/editor-tracker) stores chats in differing formats and locations. All are [subject to change](https://forum.cursor.com/t/questions-about-state-vscdb/47299/2) at anytime. We're currently focused on making the best possible extension for Cursor.



    Curious about the hype around the different AI code editors? Us too. That's why we created the [AI Editor Tracker](https://specstory.com/editor-tracker) to follow the sentiment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does this extension work?">
    In a nutshell, SpecStory allows you to save and share your AI conversation history. To do so it reads your local chat history directly from a `sqlite3` database. This is located in different paths depending on your operating system:

    * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb`

    * MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`

    * Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`

    For more detail about each SpecStory feature check out [our feature page](/features). For insight into what data we collect and access to deliver SpecStory look at [our data privacy page](/privacy).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="If I need help how can I reach you?">
    Don't be shy: we'd absolutely love to hear from you and promise to be extra responsive!

    1. Drop us a line at [support@specstory.com](mailto:support@specstory.com).

    2. Join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/specstory/shared_invite/zt-2vq0274ck-MYS39rgOpDSmgfE1IeK9gg) and ping us directly

    3. File an [issue on github](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will you open source the extension?">
    The extension is still in active development with rapid iterations. We've talked about this internally but have not made a decision.

    We do strive to be as open as possible in terms of [how it works](/features), what [data is accessed and stored](/privacy) and [what our policy is](https://specstory.com/privacy).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import my SpecStory history back into Cursor?">
    Not today. We do not conduct write operations on the `state.vscdb` or the [Shadow Workspace](https://www.cursor.com/blog/shadow-workspace) Cursor maintains.

    You can `@` reference these files to provide context to your AI though!
