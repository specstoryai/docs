  <Accordion title="Does it cost money to use SpecStory? BearClaude?">
    The SpecStory Extension is [free as in beer üç∫](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/620/what-is-the-difference-between-free-as-in-beer-and-free-as-in-speech). Enjoy! BearClaude is available for free during the Alpha, but will have [paid tiers](https://bearclaude.specstory.com/pricing) when we launch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I support you?">
    Sharing is caring! We'd absolutely love if you could:

    - Tell your friends about SpecStory.
    - Introduce us to a colleague at work.
    - Consider [purchasing](https://bearclaude.specstory.com/pricing) BearClaude when it launches.
    - [Leave a review](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecStory.specstory-vscode&ssr=false#review-details) on the VS Code Marketplace
    - Talk about us on [Cursor Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/), [Cursor Forums](https://forum.cursor.com/), [GitHub Copilot Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/), X.com, BlueSky and  LinkedIn.

  <Accordion title="Will you support other AI Code IDEs?">
    We get this question a lot! Each [AI Code IDE](https://specstory.com/editor-tracker) stores chats in differing formats and locations. All are [subject to change](https://forum.cursor.com/t/questions-about-state-vscdb/47299/2) at anytime. We're currently focused on making the best possible extension for GitHub Copilot & Cursor with **SpecStory**.

    **BearClaude** takes a different approach as a standalone macOS app with integrated Claude Code, so it doesn't depend on other editors.

    We would like to make SpecStory available for Windsurf. Tell them your interested in making your chats available on this [issue](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium/issues/127)!

    Curious about the hype around the different AI code editors? Us too. That's why we created the [AI Editor Tracker](https://specstory.com/editor-tracker) to follow the sentiment.

  <Accordion title="How does this extension work?">
    In a nutshell, SpecStory allows you to save and share your AI conversation history.

    For Cursor, it reads your local chat history directly from a `sqlite3` database. This is located in different paths depending on your operating system:

    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb`
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`
    - Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`

    For GitHub Copilot, it reads your local chat history directly from chat jsons:

    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\{hash}\chatSessions`
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/{hash}/chatSessions`
    - Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/{hash}/chatSessions`

    For Claude Code, the SpecStory CLI wrapper acts as a launcher that:

    - Runs Claude Code while capturing your conversations
    - Reads session files from `~/.claude/projects/` (JSONL format)
    - Converts them to markdown and saves to `.specstory/history/` in your project
    - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

    **BearClaude** is a standalone macOS application that provides a three-pane interface combining document management, markdown editing, and Claude Code integration. It automatically saves your Claude Code conversations to your project's `.specstory` folder.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will you open source these tools?">
    Both tools are still in active development with rapid iterations. We've talked about this internally but have not made a decision.

    We do strive to be as open as possible in terms of how they work, what data is accessed and stored and [what our policy is](https://specstory.com/privacy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import my SpecStory history back into my editor?">
    Not today. We do not conduct write operations on the `state.vscdb` or the [Shadow Workspace](https://www.cursor.com/blog/shadow-workspace) Cursor maintains. We do not modify the `workspaceStorage` directory Copilot maintains.

    You can `@` reference (in Cursor) or `#` reference (Copilot) these files to provide context to your AI though!
