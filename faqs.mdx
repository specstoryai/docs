  <Accordion title="Will you support other AI code tools?">
    We get this question a lot! Each [AI coding tool](https://specstory.com/editor-tracker) stores chats in differing formats and locations. All are [subject to change](https://forum.cursor.com/t/questions-about-state-vscdb/47299/2) at anytime. We're currently focused on supporting the broadest set of tools with **SpecStory**.

    We would like to make SpecStory available for Windsurf/Google Antigravity. Tell them your interested in making your chats available on this [issue](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium/issues/127)!

    Curious about the hype around the different AI coding tools? Us too. That's why we created the [AI Editor Tracker](https://specstory.com/editor-tracker) to follow the sentiment.

  <Accordion title="How does this extension work?">
    In a nutshell, SpecStory allows you to save and share your AI conversation history.

    For Cursor, it reads your local chat history directly from a `sqlite3` database. This is located in different paths depending on your operating system:

    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb`
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`
    - Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`

    For GitHub Copilot, it reads your local chat history directly from chat jsons:

    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\{hash}\chatSessions`
    - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/{hash}/chatSessions`
    - Linux: `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/{hash}/chatSessions`

    For Claude Code, the SpecStory CLI wrapper acts as a launcher that:

    - Runs Claude Code while capturing your conversations
    - Reads session files from `~/.claude/projects/` (JSONL format)
    - Converts them to markdown and saves to `.specstory/history/` in your project
    - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will you open source these tools?">
    Both tools are still in active development with rapid iterations. We've talked about this internally but have not made a decision.

    We do strive to be as open as possible in terms of how they work, what data is accessed and stored and [what our policy is](https://specstory.com/privacy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import my SpecStory history back into my editor?">
    Not today. We do not conduct write operations on the `state.vscdb` or the [Shadow Workspace](https://www.cursor.com/blog/shadow-workspace) Cursor maintains. We do not modify the `workspaceStorage` directory Copilot maintains.

    You can `@` reference (in Cursor) or `#` reference (Copilot) these files to provide context to your AI though!
