## Plan First, Build Better

> "Plan first, act second. Every successful software project starts with a plan."

SpecFlow is an **open methodology for AI-assisted software development**.
Where tools like Cursor, Copilot, or Claude Code accelerate *what* gets built, SpecFlow ensures you stay intentional about *why* and *how* it gets built.

Think of it as a **blueprint for human-AI collaboration**. Instead of vibe-driven development that leads to chaos, SpecFlow brings structure, clarity, and predictable results.

## Why SpecFlow?

Unstructured AI development often leads to:
- **Misaligned outputs** that don’t reflect your intent
- **Wasted time** on repeated, unfocused iterations
- **Fragmented results** across different tools and sessions
- **Lost context** between different development phases when reasoning isn’t documented

SpecFlow solves these problems by giving you a simple, repeatable process.

## The SpecFlow Process

SpecFlow provides a clear five-step workflow:

**Intent → Roadmap → Tasks → Execute → Refine**

1. **Intent:**
   Capture the *why*. Define goals, tradeoffs, and constraints before generating code.

2. **Roadmap:**
   Break down the problem into phases or milestones that map to features or modules.

3. **Tasks:**
   Translate each roadmap step into concrete AI coding tasks with clear prompts.

4. **Execute:**
   Use your AI coding tool of choice (Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code) to implement. Capture the reasoning with SpecStory.

5. **Refine:**
   Test, review, and iterate. Update decisions and document learnings so your intent evolves with the code.

## Example: Building with SpecFlow

Let’s say you’re adding authentication to a web app:

- **Intent**: “We need secure, passwordless login with email links.”
- **Roadmap**: Identify flows → choose library → integrate backend → connect frontend → test edge cases.
- **Tasks**:
  - *Task 1*: Prompt AI to draft backend auth logic with library "X".
  - *Task 2*: Generate React login component.
  - *Task 3*: Write integration tests for login edge cases.
- **Execute**: Run tasks in Cursor or Copilot, reasoning saved by SpecStory.
- **Refine**: Debug failures, iterate, update the roadmap if library choice changes.

This results in not just working code, but a **documented trail of decisions** that your team can reuse.
