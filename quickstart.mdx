## 🪄 Your work saves itself, no cloud required!

When you install SpecStory it begins its work in the background, **automatically saving 🗄️** your composer and chat history for your active project in `./specstory/history`. 

You can toggle this on and off in our settings.

### 🎯 Cherry pick your save worthy moments

If you want to combine selected conversations into a single file, you can do that too. Just open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `SpecStory: Save Composer and Chat History`.
