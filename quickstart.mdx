## 🪄 Your work saves itself, no cloud required!

When you install SpecStory it begins its work in the background, **automatically saving 🗄️** your composer and chat history for your active project in `./specstory/history`. 

You can toggle this on and off in our [settings](/settings).

## 🎯 Cherry pick your save worthy moments

If you want to combine selected conversations into a single file, you can do that too. Just open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `SpecStory: Save Composer and Chat History`.

- **💾 Like what you see?** Hit that Save button and your AI wisdom is safely tucked into your project files.
- **🌳 Feeling git-ty?** Commit it to your repo just like any other file - because your AI conversations deserve version control too!

## 🧪 Auto-magically derive Cursor Project Rules

<Info>
This an _experimental_ feature that launched in Specstory  [v0.7.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog). Unlike all of the above features, it's use requires:
- Have Auto-save enabled.
- Create an account and sign-in to the Specstory extension.  
</Info> 

_❓ Unfamiliar with what Cursor Project Rules are? Consult the [official docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended) or [Cursor101.com](https://cursor101.com/cursor/rules)._

There isn't a pallette command this one. When you chat with composer, SpecStory is like a mystical scribe in the corner, quill poised, noting patterns in:

- **🧠 Your thinking style:** Do you prefer step-by-step explanations or quick solutions?
- **🖋️ Your rule file headers:** Those special incantations you set the structure of your derived file with.
- **🔄 Your iteration cycles:** How you refine code and conversation together with AI.
- **🏗️ Your project structure:** The architecture of your digital temple.

Then—abracadabra!—SpecStory transmutes these observations into Cursor Project Rules, stored in the .cursor/rules directory as `derived-cursor-rules.mdc`.

**🌈 Prompt Headers: The Secret Ingredient**

SpecStory needs your rule file headers to brew the perfect rules. To start you off, we've crafted a default based on distilled knowledge from the [community hive mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hwwo60/top_crowdsourced_wisdom_for_effectively/) of what tends to work best.

**🌟 The Benefits of this Sorcery**

- **🧙‍♀️ Less repetitive incantations:** Reduced need to constantly explain your preferences every time.
- **⚡ Faster spell-casting:** AI responses align with your project from the start.
- **🔄 Self-improving magic:** As you work, the rules evolve to match your growing expertise.
