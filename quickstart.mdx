## 🪄 Your work saves itself, no cloud required!

When you install SpecStory it begins its work in the background, **automatically saving 🗄️** your AI chat history for your active project in `./specstory/history`.

You can toggle this on and off in our [settings](/settings).

## 🎯 Cherry pick your save worthy moments

If you want to combine selected conversations into a single file, you can do that too. Just open the command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) and run `SpecStory: Save AI Chat History`.

* **💾 Like what you see?** Hit that Save button and your AI wisdom is safely tucked into your project files.

* **🌳 Feeling git-ty?** Commit it to your repo just like any other file - because your AI conversations deserve version control too!

## 🌟 Share your history with a story!

Share your chat history with others by opening the command pallette and running `SpecStory: Share AI History`.

* **🌎 Ready to share your AI coding adventures with the world?** One command sends your chat history sailing into the cloud, returning a magical URL just for you!

* **🎭 No signup required** - your shares are anonymous. (But hey, keep those secret API keys and passwords to yourself, okay?)

* **🔗 Pro tip:** Bookmark that special URL like it's your favorite cat gif - you'll want it later!

* **✏️ As the creator, you can add a description to your share, paste images, and curate which chats to include.**

* **🗑️ Having second thoughts?** Need to make something disappear? Drop us a line at [support@specstory.com](mailto:support@specstory.com) **with a link to the share** and we'll take care of it faster than you can say "delete my search history."

<Info>
  This is a feature that launched in SpecStory [v0.7.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) for Cursor. It is updated to support both Copilot and Cursor in `v0.11.0`. Unlike all of the above features, it's use requires you to:

  * Have Auto-save enabled.

  * Create an account and sign-in to the SpecStory extension.
</Info>

* **❓ Unfamiliar with what rules for AI are?** Consult their respective docs:

  - Copilot [custom instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)
  - Cursor [project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended) *or* [Cursor101.com](https://cursor101.com/cursor/rules)*.*


There isn't a palette command this one. When you chat with AI, SpecStory is like a mystical scribe in the corner, quill poised, noting patterns in:

* **🧠 Your thinking style:** Do you prefer step-by-step explanations or quick solutions?

* **🖋️ Your rule file headers:** Those special incantations you set the structure of your derived file with.

* **🔄 Your iteration cycles:** How you refine code and conversation together with AI.

* **🏗️ Your project structure:** The architecture of your digital temple.

Then—abracadabra!—SpecStory transmutes these observations into editor specific rules for AI. Stored in either:
    1. the `.github/` directory as `copilot-instructions.md`
    2. the `.cursor/rules` directory as `derived-rules.mdc`.

**🌈 Prompt Headers: The Secret Ingredient**

SpecStory needs your rule file headers to brew the perfect rules. To start you off, we've crafted a default based on distilled knowledge from the [community hive mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1hwwo60/top_crowdsourced_wisdom_for_effectively/) of what tends to work best.

**🌟 The Benefits of this Sorcery**

* **🧙‍♀️ Less repetitive incantations:** Reduced need to constantly explain your preferences every time.

* **⚡ Faster spell-casting:** AI responses align with your project from the start.

* **🔄 Self-improving magic:** As you work, the rules evolve to match your growing expertise.
