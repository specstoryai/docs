<Info>
  The SpecStory extension is only for use with the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) editor. Because Cursor does not work with the standard Visual Studio Extension Marketplace, we recommend installing SpecStory manually using the method below.
</Info>

## Supercharge your Cursor experience

**How to install:**

* Make sure you're on the latest version of Cursor.

* Download the extension: [specstory-vscode-latest.vsix](https://static.specstory.com/vscode-extension/releases/specstory-vscode-latest.vsix)

* From Cursor, pop open the Command Palette (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and choose `Extensions: Install from VSIX‚Ä¶`.

* Select the VSIX file that you downloaded above.

* To verify the installation, open the Command Palette again (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and type `SpecStory`. You should see the available commands show up.

Why not install directly from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecStory.specstory-vscode) banner? You might find yourself in a state where VS Code has SpecStory but Cursor doesn't. [It makes for a bad time](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues/8). No one wants that.

## Why this will rock your world

Think of [SpecStory](https://specstory.com) as your AI conversation time machine.

We turn those brilliant coding chats into something both humans AND machines can digest (in fancy Markdown format). We even do it automatically!

‚ö° Your AI companion is about to get significantly less forgetful, and you won't have to lift a finger - let's go!

## Do cool stuff

* üìö Save your AI / human conversations for future-you (trust us, they'll thank you).

* üóÑÔ∏è Leave Auto Save on and never lose a single conversation.

* üß† Drop some knowledge bombs with @ references in your composer sessions. Yes, it's kind of meta, but you can save your chat/composer history to a markdown file in your project, then reference all or part of it in your next chat or in a new project.

* üåê Show off your coding adventures with shareable URLs at share.specstory.com. Send anyone and everyone a link and they'll be able to read and search your AI coding conversations.

* üìã Stash those golden conversations in your favorite task manager. Break apart your todos and create a work plan for your next coding session.

It's like a memory upgrade for your AI assistant, but way more fun
