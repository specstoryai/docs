## Supercharge your Cursor experience

- **Option 1:** Sprint to [the Visual Studio Marketplace](http://get.specstory.com/cursor-extension) and smash that `Install` button
- **Option 2:** Pop open your Extensions sidebar (it's like a vending machine for coding superpowers) and search for "SpecStory"

Both paths lead to us - pick your favorite!

## Why this will rock your world

Think of [SpecStory](https://specstory.com) as your AI conversation time machine. 

We turn those brilliant coding chats into something both humans AND machines can digest (in fancy Markdown format).

‚ö° Your AI companion is about to get significantly less forgetful, let's go!


## Do cool stuff 

- üìö Save your AI / human conversations for future-you (trust us, they'll thank you).
- üß† Drop some knowledge bombs with @ references in your composer sessions. Yes, it's kind of meta, but you can save your chat/composer history to a markdown file in your project, then reference all or part of it in your next chat or in a new project.
- üåê Show off your coding adventures with shareable URLs at share.specstory.com. Send anyone and everyone a link and they'll be able to read and search your AI coding conversations.
- üìã Stash those golden conversations in your favorite task manager. Break apart your todos and create a work plan for your next coding session.

It's like a memory upgrade for your AI assistant, but way more fun
