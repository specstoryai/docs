## Supercharge your Cursor experience

- **Preferred Option 1:** Pop open your Extensions sidebar in the Cursor IDE (it's like a vending machine for coding superpowers) and search for "SpecStory". Smash that `Install` button.
- **Alternative Option 2:** Sprint to [the Visual Studio Marketplace](http://get.specstory.com/cursor-extension) and follow the below instructions to `install` the extension by first downloading the VSIX file under Resources from the Overview page.
    -  From Cursor, pop open the Command Palette (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and choose `Extensions: Install from VSIX‚Ä¶`.
    -  Select the VSIX file that you downloaded above.
    -  Verify that "SpecStory (Cursor Extension)" appears in Extensions sidebar. Sweet success!

Why not install directly from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](http://get.specstory.com/cursor-extension) `install` banner? You might find yourself in a state where VS Code has SpecStory but Cursor doesn't. [It's leads to whole lot of bad time](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues/8). No one wants that.

But both of the other options above lead directly to us - so pick your favorite!

## Why this will rock your world

Think of [SpecStory](https://specstory.com) as your AI conversation time machine. 

We turn those brilliant coding chats into something both humans AND machines can digest (in fancy Markdown format).

‚ö° Your AI companion is about to get significantly less forgetful, let's go!


## Do cool stuff 

- üìö Save your AI / human conversations for future-you (trust us, they'll thank you).
- üß† Drop some knowledge bombs with @ references in your composer sessions. Yes, it's kind of meta, but you can save your chat/composer history to a markdown file in your project, then reference all or part of it in your next chat or in a new project.
- üåê Show off your coding adventures with shareable URLs at share.specstory.com. Send anyone and everyone a link and they'll be able to read and search your AI coding conversations.
- üìã Stash those golden conversations in your favorite task manager. Break apart your todos and create a work plan for your next coding session.

It's like a memory upgrade for your AI assistant, but way more fun
