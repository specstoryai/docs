<Note>
  The SpecStory extension is only for use with the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) editor. Because Cursor does not work with the standard Visual Studio Extension Marketplace, we recommend installing SpecStory manually using the method below.
</Note>

## üç¶ Choose your flavor 

**Option 1:**
1. Make sure you're on the [latest version of Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/changelog).
2. Download our extension: [specstory-vscode-latest.vsix](https://static.specstory.com/vscode-extension/releases/specstory-vscode-latest.vsix)
3. From Cursor, pop open the Command Palette (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and choose `Extensions: Install from VSIX‚Ä¶`.
5. To verify the installation, open the Command Palette again (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and type `SpecStory`. You should see the available commands show up.

**Option 2:**
1. Open Cursor.
2. Open the Extensions View in the Primary Sidebar (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-X).
3. Search for `SpecStory` and click Install. Consult our [Changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) to make sure you're on the latest version. 

<Tip>
If you install from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecStory.specstory-vscode) banner you might find yourself in a state where VSCode has SpecStory installed but Cursor doesn't. [It makes for a bad time](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues/8). No one wants that.
