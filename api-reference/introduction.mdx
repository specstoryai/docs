# SpecStory Cloud API

The SpecStory Cloud API provides programmatic access to your AI conversation data, enabling you to build custom integrations, automate workflows, and create powerful applications on top of your SpecStory ecosystem.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://cloud.specstory.com
```

## API Overview

SpecStory Cloud offers two complementary interfaces:

### REST API
Perfect for standard CRUD operations on projects and sessions:
- **Projects**: Manage workspaces and organize your AI conversations
- **Sessions**: Access, retrieve, and manage individual AI conversation sessions
- **Metadata**: Rich context including git branches, LLM models, client information, and tags

### GraphQL API
Advanced querying interface for complex operations:
- **Complex Queries**: Multi-entity queries with relationships
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter sessions by metadata, tags, dates, and more
- **Full-Text Search**: Search across session content with relevance ranking
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Request exactly the data you need

## Key Features

### ETag Support
Efficient caching and conditional requests using ETags for optimal performance when working with session data.

### Multiple Content Types
- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic access
- **Markdown**: Raw conversation content for direct consumption

### Rich Metadata
Every session includes comprehensive metadata:
- **Client Information**: Name, version, and device details
- **Git Context**: Branch information for code-related conversations
- **LLM Models**: Track which AI models were used
- **Custom Tags**: Organize and categorize your conversations

## Rate Limits

The SpecStory Cloud API implements reasonable rate limits to ensure service quality:

- **REST API**: 1000 requests per hour per API key
- **GraphQL API**: 500 queries per hour per API key

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your rate limit ceiling for that given request
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests left for the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: UTC epoch seconds when the rate limit resets

## SDKs and Libraries

While the SpecStory Cloud API is REST and GraphQL based, we're working on official SDKs:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Coming soon
- **Python**: Coming soon
- **Go**: Coming soon

In the meantime, you can use any HTTP client or GraphQL library with the API endpoints documented here.
