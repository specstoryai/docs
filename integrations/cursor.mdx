title: "Cursor"
---

SpecStory integrates seamlessly with [Cursor](https://cursor.com). Cursor already helps developers move faster with **inline edits**, **multi-line completions**, and **codebase chat**. SpecStory adds the missing layer by capturing *why* the changes were made.

With SpecStory enabled, every AI conversation in Cursor is **auto-saved as Markdown** in your project. Your reasoning, tradeoffs, and design decisions live alongside your code: versioned, reusable, and shareable.


## Install the SpecStory Extension

1. Open **Cursor**.
2. Go to **Extensions Marketplace** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+X`).
3. Search for **SpecStory** and click **Install**.
4. Verify installation:
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`).
   - Type `SpecStory`, the commands should appear.

<Warning>
If you install SpecStory directly from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecStory.specstory-vscode) website, you may end up with VS Code having the extension but not Cursor. Always install directly from inside Cursor to avoid this issue.
</Warning>

## Verify It Works

- Start a chat with Cursor’s AI.
- Open your project folder.
- You should now see a new `.specstory/history/` directory.
- Inside, you should see a Markdown file of your session, named with a timestamp.

<Tip>
SpecStory is **local-first** by default. Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly share it.
</Tip>

## How SpecStory Enhances Cursor

- **Auto-save:** Every AI conversations in Cursor are automatically stored in `.specstory/history/` as clean Markdown.
- **Manual saves:** From the Command Palette, run `SpecStory: Save AI Chat History` to cherry-pick and combine conversations.
- **Share conversations with a URL:** Use `SpecStory: Share AI Chat History` to generate a private, anonymous link at `share.specstory.com`.

- **Derived rules for AI:** SpecStory can extract project-level rules and custom instructions from your chats, feeding them back into Cursor to improve suggestions.

<Info>
Rule derivation requires:
- Auto-save enabled.
- Signed-in SpecStory extension.

## Best Practices for Cursor Users

- **Commit your history**: Include `.specstory/history/` in your repo so teammates can review reasoning in PRs.
- **Use manual saves before big changes**: Preserve the conversation context before accepting multi-line or agent-driven edits.
- **Leverage derived rules**: Cursor’s [Project Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended) evolve automatically when SpecStory is active.

## Why This Matters

Cursor accelerates *what* changes in your codebase. SpecStory ensures you never lose *why* those changes happened.
Together, they give you:

- Faster debugging and onboarding
- Traceable architectural decisions
- Cleaner collaboration on AI-assisted code

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension mismatch**: If VS Code shows SpecStory installed but Cursor doesn’t, uninstall and reinstall from Cursor’s built-in Marketplace.
- **No `.specstory` folder**: Make sure you have an active project folder open. SpecStory only saves inside projects.
- **Still stuck**? File an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues) or contact [support@specstory.com](mailto:support@specstory.com).
