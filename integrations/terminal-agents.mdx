title: "Terminal Agents"
---

SpecStory complements [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), and [Codex CLI](https://www.openai.com/codex/cli/), agentic AI coding tools that run in your terminal. These agents automate coding tasks like brainstorming, editing, testing, and PR creation. SpecStory adds the missing layer: **capturing the reasoning and decisions behind those sessions as clean Markdown**.

With SpecStory, every interaction with an agent becomes a versioned, searchable, and shareable artifact you can keep alongside your code.

## What are terminal coding agents?

Claude Code, Cursor CLI and Codex CLI run in your terminal and understand your entire codebase via agentic AI (powered by foundation models such as  Sonnet 4, Opus 4.1 and GPT-5), enabling everything from full-stack edits to CI integration, all without context-switching. They support:

- Autonomous multi-file edits & PR creation
- Intelligent file navigation and dependency awareness
- Slash commands, GitHub CLI (`gh`), and external toolchain interoperability

## Install SpecStory CLI

### macOS (via Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory
specstory version
specstory check
```

### Linux / WSL

Download and install the latest binaries for your platform from [our GitHub releases](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases) and move it into your PATH:.

```bash
sudo mv specstory /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/specstory
```

Verify with:

```bash
specstory version
specstory check
```

## Usage: Capture Your Claude Code Sessions

Run Claude Code through SpecStory to automatically capture your sessions:

```bash
# Launch Claude Code with automated capture
specstory run claude

# Launch Cursor CLI with automated capture
specstory run cursor

# Launch Codex CLI with automated capture
specstory run codex
```

Conversations will be stored in `.specstory/history/` as timestamped Markdown.

## Understanding `specstory sync`

The `sync` command ensures you can **retroactively capture Claude Code history**, even if you didn’t start with `specstory run`.

This makes `specstory sync` invaluable if you ever forget to wrap a session or want to batch-export past work.

**Convert all sessions**:

```bash
specstory sync
```

Exports _all_ Claude Code and Cursor CLI sessions into `.specstory/history/*.md`.

**Sync a single session**:

```bash
specstory sync claude -s <session-uuid>

specstory sync cursor -s <session-uuid>

specstory sync codex -s <session-uuid>
```

Converts only one session by its ID.

**Debug with log output**:

```bash
specstory sync --debug --log
```

## Enhancing AI Coding Workflows

- **Full-history capture**: Each agent session is saved as clean Markdown.
- **Reusable context**: Revisit and reuse design discussions without rerunning prompts.
- **Portable reasoning**: Sessions history stay with your repo, not locked in a terminal buffer.
- **CLI-first logic**: Ideal for developers who prefer terminal workflows and composability.

## Pro Tips & Best Practices

- **`Use /clear between tasks`**: Keeps new sessions focused and token-efficient.
- **`Use !command for shell context`**: Great for feeding in outputs (`!ls`, `!grep`, etc.).
- **Enable auto-mode carefully**: Allows unattended editing (`–dangerously-skip-permissions`), but only for trusted projects.
- `Leverage /init to create a CLAUDE.md`: Gives Claude Code persistent project knowledge.
- **Document custom tools**: Add context for custom scripts, CI helpers, or CLI tools via `CLAUDE.md` to guide Claude intelligently.

## Why This Matters

Claude Code and Cursor CLI let you **act via AI** in your terminal. SpecStory ensures you _understand why_ those actions happened. This combination delivers:

- Better traceability for agentic edits
- Historical context to aid collaboration and debates
- Easily composable workflows via Markdown rather than closed UI prompts

## Troubleshooting

- `specstory run` not capturing: Ensure `claude`, `cursor-agent` or `codex` are in your PATH and that a session starts.
- `.specstory/history/` has no output: Run `specstory sync` to convert past sessions.
- `specstory sync` shows nothing: Verify the terminal agent has existing sessions in the current working directory.
- **Permission issues on macOS/Linux**: Avoid running as root, check file permissions in your project folder.
