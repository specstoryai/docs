title: "Gemini CLI"
---

Gemini CLI gives you Gemini-powered code edits and reasoning straight from the terminal. Pair it with SpecStory to convert every session into reusable Markdown notes.

## Install SpecStory CLI

Install the SpecStory CLI once to wrap the Gemini CLI and manage your transcripts.

```bash
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory
specstory version
specstory check
```

<Info>
  Need Linux or WSL binaries or installing manually? Download the archive that matches your OS and architecture (for example `SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` or `SpecStoryCLI_Darwin_arm64.zip`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases), make them executable, and move them into your `PATH`.

  ```bash
  tar -xzf SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz   # unzip the Darwin archive on macOS
  sudo mv specstory /usr/local/bin/
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/specstory
  specstory version
  ```

  Swap the archive name for the asset you downloaded and repeat when upgrading.

## Run Gemini CLI with auto-save

Launch Gemini CLI through SpecStory to capture a Markdown history in `.specstory/history/`.

```bash
specstory run gemini
```

You use Gemini CLI as normal while SpecStory records the entire conversation and context.

## Sync older Gemini CLI sessions

If you used Gemini CLI before installing SpecStory, retroactively export existing sessions.

```bash
# Convert every stored Gemini CLI session
specstory sync gemini

# Convert a single session by UUID
specstory sync gemini -s <session-uuid>

# Watch the sync progress
specstory sync gemini --console
```

The resulting Markdown files live under `.specstory/history/` with timestamps and metadata for easy sharing.

## Best practices

- **Segment workstreams**: Use Gemini CLI’s commands to start fresh sessions per task so transcripts stay focused.
- **Document custom tooling**: Add notes about bespoke scripts or workflows to the Markdown files for teammate handoff.
- **Archive transcripts**: Commit `.specstory/history/` alongside your code to preserve design intent.

## Troubleshooting

- `gemini` command missing: Confirm installation by running `gemini --version` outside SpecStory.
- No Markdown output: Run inside a project directory that contains `.specstory/` and allows writing.
- Sync returns nothing: Ensure Gemini CLI has existing session logs in the current workspace.
