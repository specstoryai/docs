SpecStory complements [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), and [Codex CLI](https://www.openai.com/codex/cli/), terminal-first AI coding agents that automate edits, testing, and PR workflows. SpecStory wraps these agents so every command, response, and decision becomes Markdown you can review and share.

## Why wrap terminal agents with SpecStory?

- **Portable reasoning**: Markdown transcripts travel with your repository, not a volatile terminal scrollback.
- **Retroactive capture**: `specstory sync` converts past Claude, Cursor, or Codex sessions even if you forgot to wrap them.
- **Team-friendly context**: Share the “why” behind automation-driven edits in pull requests and docs.
- **CLI-first flexibility**: Keep your existing commands, aliases, and automations while SpecStory observes in the background.

## Universal workflow

```bash
# 1. Install or update the SpecStory CLI
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory

# 2. Run your preferred agent through SpecStory (choose one)
specstory run claude   # or cursor / claude

# 3. Export past sessions (pick the agent you used)
specstory sync claude  # or cursor / claude
```

Transcripts land in `.specstory/history/` with timestamps and metadata ready for code review or knowledge sharing.

## Understand `specstory sync`

`specstory sync` retroactively exports chat history, making it useful when you forget to start with `specstory run` or want to convert older work.

- `specstory sync`: export every available session (Claude, Cursor, Codex) for the current project.
- `specstory sync claude -s <session-uuid>`: convert a specific Claude session by its UUID.
- `specstory sync cursor --console`: watch verbose logging while exporting Cursor CLI sessions.
- `specstory sync codex`: capture all stored Codex CLI conversations.

All generated Markdown ends up in `.specstory/history/*.md`, grouped by timestamp and agent.

## Tips for every agent

- Use `/clear` (or the agent’s reset command) between tasks to keep transcripts scoped.
- Feed shell context with `!` commands so SpecStory captures inputs and outputs together.
- Commit `.specstory/history/` alongside code to preserve design intent and debugging rationale.
- Store persistent project notes (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`) so agents stay aligned across sessions.

## Troubleshooting

- `specstory run` shows nothing: confirm the agent binary (`claude`, `cursor-agent`, or `codex`) is installed and in your `PATH`.
- No Markdown written: ensure you are inside a writable project folder when launching the wrapper.
- Sync exports zero files: verify the agent has stored session history in the current working directory.
