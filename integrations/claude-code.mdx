title: "Claude Code"
---

Claude Code gives you an AI pair-programmer directly in the terminal. Run it through SpecStory to capture every step of the conversation as Markdown that ships with your repo.

## Install SpecStory CLI

Install or update the SpecStory CLI so it can wrap `claude` and archive the session output.

```bash
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory
specstory version
specstory check
```

<Info>
  Need Linux or WSL binaries or installing manually? Download the archive that matches your OS and architecture (for example `SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` or `SpecStoryCLI_Darwin_arm64.zip`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases), make them executable, and move them into your `PATH`.

  ```bash
  tar -xzf SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz   # unzip the Darwin archive on macOS
  sudo mv specstory /usr/local/bin/
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/specstory
  specstory version
  ```

  Swap the archive name for the asset you downloaded and repeat when upgrading.

## Run Claude Code with auto-save

Start Claude Code through SpecStory to collect a Markdown transcript in `.specstory/history/`.

```bash
specstory run claude
```

While the wrapper is active you can use the full Claude Code feature set, including multi-file edits, `/init`, `/clear`, and slash commands. SpecStory records both sides of the chat plus terminal output generated by `!` commands.

## Sync existing Claude Code sessions

Forgot to launch with `specstory run`? Convert prior sessions with `specstory sync`.

```bash
# Convert everything Claude Code has stored locally
specstory sync claude

# Export a single session by ID
specstory sync claude -s <session-uuid>

# Inspect sync logs in your terminal
specstory sync claude --console
```

Resulting Markdown files land in `.specstory/history/` alongside timestamps and command metadata.

## Command reference

Use the wrapper exactly as you would the native CLI while taking advantage of additional flags.

```
Usage: specstory [command] [--flags]

Commands:
  check        Verify Claude Code can be invoked and autosave is configured
  run          Launch Claude Code with SpecStory capturing the session
  sync         Convert stored Claude Code sessions to Markdown
  version      Show SpecStory version information

Common flags:
  --console            Stream logs to stdout for easier debugging
  --debug              Include verbose diagnostics (requires --console or --log)
  --output-dir <path>  Write Markdown exports to a custom location
  --no-version-check   Skip the update check
  --silent             Reduce output to errors only
```

Typical workflows:

```bash
# Launch Claude Code with autosave enabled
specstory run

# Recreate any missing Markdown transcripts
specstory sync

# Convert a specific session by UUID
specstory sync -u <session-uuid>

# Mirror Claude logs in your terminal
specstory sync --console

# Use a custom Claude executable
specstory run -c "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

## Turn transcripts into documentation

SpecStory focuses on local Markdown output so you can share conversations using existing workflows:

- Commit `.specstory/history/` to version control for review alongside code changes.
- Send Markdown files directly to teammates or attach them to design docs.
- Publish excerpts in knowledge bases or documentation portals.

The generated files preserve timestamps, terminal output, and code blocks, creating a searchable log of every Claude Code session.

## Best practices

- **Create `CLAUDE.md`**: Seed the assistant with project docs once, and re-use those instructions automatically.
- **Keep sessions focused**: Use `/clear` between tasks so transcripts stay tight and portable.
- **Commit your transcripts**: Include `.specstory/history/` in pull requests to explain why edits shipped.
- **Annotate exports**: Because the transcripts are plain Markdown, you can add context before sharing or committing them.

## Troubleshooting

- `claude` command missing: Run `claude --version` outside SpecStory to verify installing Anthropic's CLI.
- No Markdown output: Make sure you start `specstory run claude` inside a writable project folder.
- `specstory sync` finds nothing: Claude Code must have an existing session database in the current directory.
