title: "Claude Code"
---

Claude Code gives you an AI pair-programmer directly in the terminal. Run it through SpecStory to capture every step of the conversation as Markdown that ships with your repo.

## Install SpecStory CLI

Install or update the SpecStory CLI so it can wrap `claude` and archive the session output.

```bash
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory
specstory version
specstory check
```

<Info>
  Linux / WSL users: download the latest binary from the [SpecStory releases](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases), mark it executable, and move it into your `PATH`.

## Run Claude Code with auto-save

Start Claude Code through SpecStory to collect a Markdown transcript in `.specstory/history/`.

```bash
specstory run claude
```

While the wrapper is active you can use the full Claude Code feature set, including multi-file edits, `/init`, `/clear`, and slash commands. SpecStory records both sides of the chat plus terminal output generated by `!` commands.

## Sync existing Claude Code sessions

Forgot to launch with `specstory run`? Convert prior sessions with `specstory sync`.

```bash
# Convert everything Claude Code has stored locally
specstory sync claude

# Export a single session by ID
specstory sync claude -s <session-uuid>

# Inspect sync logs in your terminal
specstory sync claude --console
```

Resulting Markdown files land in `.specstory/history/` alongside timestamps and command metadata.

## Best practices

- **Create `CLAUDE.md`**: Seed the assistant with project docs once, and re-use those instructions automatically.
- **Keep sessions focused**: Use `/clear` between tasks so transcripts stay tight and portable.
- **Commit your transcripts**: Include `.specstory/history/` in pull requests to explain why edits shipped.

## Troubleshooting

- `claude` command missing: Run `claude --version` outside SpecStory to verify installing Anthropic's CLI.
- No Markdown output: Make sure you start `specstory run claude` inside a writable project folder.
- `specstory sync` finds nothing: Claude Code must have an existing session database in the current directory.
