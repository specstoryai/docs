title: "Claude Code / CLI"
---

SpecStory complements [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic’s agentic AI coding tool that runs in your terminal. Claude Code automates coding tasks like brainstorming, editing, testing, and PR creation. SpecStory adds the missing layer: **capturing the reasoning and decisions behind those sessions as clean Markdown**.

With SpecStory, every Claude Code interaction becomes a versioned, searchable, and shareable artifact you can keep alongside your code.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code runs in your terminal and understands your entire codebase via agentic AI (powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Opus 4), enabling everything from full-stack edits to CI integration, all without context-switching.
It supports:
- Autonomous multi-file edits & PR creation
- Intelligent file navigation and dependency awareness
- Slash commands, GitHub CLI (`gh`), and external toolchain interoperability

## Install SpecStory with Claude Code

### macOS (via Homebrew)
```bash
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory
specstory version
```

### Linux / WSL
Download and install the latest binaries for your platform from [our GitHub releases](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases) and move it into your PATH:.

```bash
sudo mv specstory /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/specstory
```

Verify with:
```bash
specstory version
```

## Usage: Capture Your Claude Code Sessions

Run Claude Code through SpecStory to automatically capture your sessions:
```bash
# Launch Claude Code with automated capture
specstory run
```

Conversations will be stored in `.specstory/history/` as timestamped Markdown.

## Understanding `specstory sync`

The `sync` command ensures you can **retroactively capture Claude Code history**, even if you didn’t start with `specstory run`.

**Convert all sessions**:

```bash
specstory sync
```

Exports *all* Claude Code sessions into `.specstory/history/*.md`.

**Sync a single session**:

```bash
specstory sync -u <session-uuid>
```

Converts only one session by its ID.

**Debug with console output**:

```bash
specstory sync --console
```

Streams conversion logs to the terminal.

This makes `specstory sync` invaluable if you ever forget to wrap a session or want to batch-export past work.

## Enhancing Claude Code Workflows

- **Full-history capture**: Each CLI session is saved as clean Markdown.
- **Reusable context**: Revisit and reuse design discussions without rerunning prompts.
- **Portable reasoning**: Sessions history stay with your repo, not locked in a terminal buffer.
- **CLI-first logic**: Ideal for developers who prefer terminal workflows and composability.


## Pro Tips & Best Practices

- **Use `/clear` between tasks**: Keeps new sessions focused and token-efficient.
- **Use `!command` for shell context**: Great for feeding in outputs (`!ls`, `!grep`, etc.).
- **Enable auto-mode carefully**: Allows unattended editing (`–dangerously-skip-permissions`), but only for trusted projects.
- **Leverage `/init` to create a CLAUDE.md**: Gives Claude persistent project knowledge.
- **Document custom tools**: Add context for custom scripts, CI helpers, or CLI tools via `CLAUDE.md` to guide Claude intelligently.

## Why This Matters

Claude Code lets you **act via AI** in your terminal. SpecStory ensures you *understand why* those actions happened. This combination delivers:

- Better traceability for agentic edits
- Historical context to aid collaboration and debates
- Easily composable workflows via Markdown rather than closed UI prompts


## Troubleshooting

- **`specstory run` not capturing**: Ensure `claude` is in your PATH and that a session starts.
- **No output in `.specstory/history/`**: Run `specstory sync` to convert past sessions.
- **`specstory sync` shows nothing**: Verify Claude Code has existing sessions.
- **Permission issues on macOS/Linux**: Avoid running as root, check file permissions in your project folder.
