title: "Cursor CLI"
---

Cursor CLI mirrors the Cursor editor agent inside your terminal. Wrap it with SpecStory so the full discussion stays searchable and reviewable.

## Install SpecStory CLI

Grab the CLI or keep it current before launching Cursor through SpecStory.

```bash
brew tap specstoryai/tap
brew update
brew install specstory
specstory version
specstory check
```

<Info>
  On Linux or WSL, download the latest release binary from [GitHub](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/releases), mark it executable, and move it into your `PATH`.

## Run Cursor CLI with auto-save

Capture a session by running Cursor CLI through the SpecStory wrapper.

```bash
specstory run cursor
```

SpecStory stores transcripts, tool invocations, and shell output in `.specstory/history/`. You keep the normal Cursor CLI flow while gaining reviewable context.

## Sync existing Cursor sessions

Cursor already logs prior chats locally. Convert them into Markdown after the fact with `specstory sync`.

```bash
# Export every Cursor CLI session
specstory sync cursor

# Only export one session (replace with its UUID)
specstory sync cursor -s <session-uuid>

# Watch log output during sync
specstory sync cursor --console
```

Each export creates a Markdown file named with the session timestamp. Share them in PRs or hand them to teammates as design history.

## Best practices

- **Scope conversations**: Use `/clear` or start fresh sessions per task to simplify review.
- **Pair with Editor history**: Combine Cursor CLI transcripts with `.specstory/history/` from the editor UI for an end-to-end record.
- **Include transcripts in reviews**: Point code reviewers at the relevant Markdown when opening a PR.

## Troubleshooting

- `cursor-agent` not in `PATH`: Install the Cursor CLI and verify with `cursor-agent --help`.
- No `.specstory/history/` files: Ensure you launched from inside a project folder with write permissions.
- Sync returns zero sessions: Cursor must have local session files in the working directory.
