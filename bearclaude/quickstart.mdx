## Getting Started with BearClaude

BearClaude provides a three-paned editor designed to streamline your development workflow by combining document management, markdown editing, and AI-powered code assistance in one integrated interface.

## The Three-Pane Interface

When you open BearClaude, you'll see three main sections:

- **Left Pane**: Document browser showing all markdown files in your project
- **Middle Pane**: Markdown editor for writing specs, plans, and documentation  
- **Right Pane**: Claude Code terminal for AI-powered development assistance

All three panes are resizable, so you can customize your layout to fit your preferred workflow.

## Opening a Project

BearClaude works with project-based workflows where a project is simply a folder on your Mac.

### Create or Open a Project

1. **New Project**: Create a new folder to start fresh
2. **Open Existing**: Browse and select any existing folder on your Mac
3. **Recent Projects**: Quickly access previously opened projects

Once you open a project folder, BearClaude will:
- Scan for all markdown documents in the project directory and subdirectories
- Display them in the left pane document browser
- Start Claude Code in your project's root directory

## Working with Documents

### Document Management

The left pane shows all markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) found within your project. Documents created outside of BearClaude will automatically appear here when saved to the project folder.

### Creating New Documents

1. Use **File > New Document** to create a new document in the markdown editor
2. The document will immediately appear in the left pane browser
3. As you edit, the document auto-saves
4. If you'd like to save an open document as a new file name, use **File > Save As**

### Markdown Editing Features

The middle pane provides a full-featured markdown editor with:

#### Formatting Options
- `## Headings` (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Lists:
```
- bulleted
and
1. numbered
```
- `[links](https://example.com)`
- `**Bold**` and `_italic_` text
- Code blocks:
````markdown
```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
````

Use the formatting toolbar for quick access to many of these.

#### View Modes
Toggle between:
- **Raw Text Mode**: See the raw markdown syntax
- **Stylized Mode**: Preview formatted output while editing

#### Inserting selected document text in your Claude Code prompt
- `Edit→Insert at Cursor (⌘⇧V)`: Insert selected text as your next Claude Code prompt

## Claude Code Integration

The right pane contains a Claude Code terminal that starts in your project directory, giving you AI assistance with full project context.

### Basic Usage

1. Type any prompt or question about your project
2. Reference files with `@filename` or by highlighting text and using the insert commands
3. Ask Claude Code to implement features, update documentation, or analyze your project
4. Use `/` to access the command menu. Type `/help` to see all available Claude Code commands

For more detailed information about Claude Code capabilities and commands, visit the [Anthropic Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

### Project Integration Features
- **Restart**: Use the restart button for a fresh Claude Code session
- **Open in Finder**: Quick access to your project files in macOS Finder
- **Open in Terminal**: Launch a terminal session in your project directory

## Chat History

BearClaude automatically saves your AI conversations to preserve your development history and insights:

### Auto-Save Features
- **Automatic Saving**: All Claude Code conversations are automatically saved in your project's `.specstory` folder
- **Individual Files**: Each conversation is saved as a separate markdown file for easy browsing, versioning, and sharing
- **Background Operation**: Works seamlessly without interrupting your workflow
- **Complete History**: Preserves your entire conversation history for future reference
- **Access History**: To view your autosaved chat history, switch the Documents filter to Chat History in the left pane.

Autosave ensures you never lose valuable AI interactions and can always reference previous solutions, explanations, or implementation details.


## Recommended Workflow

1. **Plan First**: Use the markdown editor to write specifications, requirements, and implementation plans
2. **Iterate with AI**: Reference your documentation in Claude Code prompts to get contextual assistance
3. **Review Documentation**: Read and manually update your specs based on your own requirements
4. **Implement**: Let Claude Code handle the technical implementation while you focus on planning and design

## Tips for Success

- Keep your project documentation organized with clear filenames
- Use descriptive headings and structure in your markdown files
- Reference specific parts of your documentation when prompting Claude Code
- Take advantage of the integrated workflow - your specs inform your implementation, and your implementation insights can improve your specs

BearClaude is designed to let you focus on **what** you're building while Claude Code handles the **how**, creating a seamless flow from planning to implementation.
