## A focused macOS tool for turning specs into software

<Note>
BearClaude for macOS also installs the `specstory` CLI for Claude Code. No need to install it separately.
</Note>

Turn Markdown specs into runnable code. Built for those who plan before they act.

## ðŸ§  The Challenge: Code is fast. Clarity is rare.

AI generates code in seconds. But many still struggle to define what they're building and why.

**BearClaude is built for that upstream work.** The specs, the reasoning, the structure. So implementation becomes effortless.

## ðŸŽ¯ From Intent to Execution

### Write structured specs
Describe user needs, edge cases, and behavior in clear Markdown.

### Refine with AI  
Get inline feedback from Apple Intelligence to sharpen intent and clarify meaning.

### Execute cleanly
Hand off polished specs to Claude Code for fast, high-fidelity implementation. No lost context.
