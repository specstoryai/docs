## Multiplatform support is now here

<Note>
The SpecStory Extension as of `v0.11.0` [(changelog)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) supports both [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
</Note>

SpecStory saves, organizes, and makes all your AI chats searchable in structured Markdown. Never lose a great solution, easily share interactions, and use conversation history to refine Copilot and Cursor with custom instructions and project rules.

## üç¶ Installation Options

We recommend you install directly from the Extension Marketplace in your preferred editor.

  <Tab title="GitHub Copilot">
    1. Open VSCode with GitHub Copilot installed and activated.
    
    2. Search for **SpecStory** in the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-X).
    
    3. Click **Install**. Consult our [Changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) to make sure you're on the latest version.
    
    4. Once installed, SpecStory automatically saves your Copilot chats to the `.specstory` folder in your project..
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
        
    1. Open Cursor.
    
    2. Search for **SpecStory** in the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-X).
    
    3. Click **Install**. Consult our [Changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/SpecStory.specstory-vscode/changelog) to make sure you're on the latest version.

    4. Once installed, SpecStory automatically saves your Cursor chats to the `.specstory` folder in your project.
    
    <Warning>
      As a Cursor user, if you try to install from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecStory.specstory-vscode) website banner you might find yourself in a state where VSCode has SpecStory installed but Cursor doesn't. [It makes for a bad time](https://github.com/specstoryai/getspecstory/issues/8). No one wants that.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Install from VSIX">
     <Tip>
     The SpecStory extension's VSIX works seamlessly with both GitHub Copilot and Cursor. You'll need to install it separately in each environment.
    </Tip>

    1. Make sure you're on the latest version of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/changelog/label/copilot/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/changelog) .
    
    2. Download our extension: [specstory-vscode-latest.vsix](https://static.specstory.com/vscode-extension/releases/specstory-vscode-latest.vsix)
    
    3. From either editor, pop open the Command Palette (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and choose `Extensions: Install from VSIX‚Ä¶`.
    
    4. To verify the installation, open the Command Palette again (Ctrl/CMD-Shift-P) and type `SpecStory`. You should see the available commands show up.
