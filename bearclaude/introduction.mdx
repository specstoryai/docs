BearClaude is a spec-first development tool that helps you think before you code. Write clear requirements and specifications in Markdown, then generate intentional code with Claude.

Perfect for developers who want a simpler alternative to full AI IDEs, BearClaude keeps your specifications and generated code connected while preserving your development intent.
