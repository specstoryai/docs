BearClaude has simple, focused settings to get you up and running quickly.

### Claude Code Configuration

**Claude Code Path**: This tells BearClaude where to find your Claude Code installation.

- **Default**: `claude` - Works with standard Claude Code installations
- **Custom Path**: If you installed Claude Code somewhere not in your shell PATH, provide the full path here (e.g., `/Applications/Claude Code.app/Contents/MacOS/claude`)

With a normal Claude Code installation, you shouldn't need to change this setting.

#### Debugging "Sad Bear"

If BearClaude is unable to verify that Claude Code can be run, you'll see the "Sad Bear" screen. If Claude Code runs fine for you in the terminal, but not in BearClaude, try downloading the SpecStory CLI for Claude Code and running `specstory check` in your terminal.

Make sure you do not have anything in your `.zshrc` or `.zprofile` that is waiting for interactive user input, as this will prevent BearClaude from starting the Claude Code session.

### Application Configuration

**Appearance**: Choose your preferred theme

- **Light:** Light mode interface
- **Dark:** Dark mode interface
- **System (Auto):** Follows your macOS system appearance setting
