## Settings

BearClaude has simple, focused settings to get you up and running quickly.

### Claude Code Configuration

**Claude Code Path**: This tells BearClaude where to find your Claude Code installation.

- **Default**: `claude` - Works with standard Claude Code installations
- **Custom Path**: If you installed Claude Code somewhere not in your shell PATH, provide the full path here (e.g., `/Applications/Claude Code.app/Contents/MacOS/claude`)

With a normal Claude Code installation, you shouldn't need to change this setting.

### Application Configuration  

**Appearance**: Choose your preferred theme
- **Light** - Light mode interface
- **Dark** - Dark mode interface  
- **System (Auto)** - Follows your macOS system appearance setting
