## Get Claude Code

* Follow these [instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) to download and setup Claude Code.
* Make sure you can run Claude Code from a standard Mac terminal. 
```
claude --version
```
* Ensure you've got an Anthropic console billing subscription or Claude Pro/Max plan.
* On the first run of `claude` you'll be walked through a configuration and authentication flow. You can do this in BearClaude, but it may be easier to complete these steps in your regular terminal first.

## Claude Code path

<Note>
Under most circumstances you shouldn't have to change this setting.
</Note>

* If `claude` is not in your default PATH, you can point BearClaude to the executable by using the `BearClaude â†’ Settings...` menu.
