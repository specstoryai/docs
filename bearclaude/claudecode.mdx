title: "Configure Claude Code"
---

BearClaude relies on [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) for AI‑assisted development. To function correctly, BearClaude needs to know the location of your local `claude` binary. Without this path, BearClaude cannot launch sessions or capture histories.

## Why configuration matters

Claude Code is a separate installation maintained by Anthropic. BearClaude provides the spec‑first workflow, while Claude Code executes and edits against your codebase. Configuring the binary path connects the two.

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

Follow Anthropic’s [official installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Once installed, verify it works:

```bash
claude --version
```

If successful, this prints the installed version of Claude Code.

* Ensure you've got an Anthropic console billing subscription or Claude Pro/Max plan.
* On the first run of `claude` you'll be walked through a configuration and authentication flow. You can do this in BearClaude, but it may be easier to complete these steps in your regular terminal first.

## Step 2: Point BearClaude to the binary

1. Open **BearClaude → Preferences → Claude Code**.
2. In the **Claude Binary Path** field, enter the path to your `claude` executable.

   * Typical macOS (Intel): `/usr/local/bin/claude`
   * Typical macOS (Apple Silicon/Homebrew): `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`
3. Use the **Browse** option if you are unsure of the path.

<Note>
Under most circumstances you shouldn't have to change this setting.
</Note>

To find where Claude Code is installed, run this command in your terminal:
```bash
which claude
```

This will show you the full path to the Claude Code executable (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/claude`), which you can then enter in BearClaude's settings.

## Step 3: Verify the connection

* Click **Test Connection** in Preferences.
* BearClaude will run a short check by invoking `claude`.
* If successful, you’ll see a confirmation message that Claude Code is ready.

## Troubleshooting

* **`command not found` when testing**
  Ensure Claude Code is installed and that the binary is in your PATH.

* **Installed via Homebrew but still failing**
  On Apple Silicon Macs, binaries often live in `/opt/homebrew/bin/`. Update the path manually.

* **Custom install locations**
  If you installed Claude Code somewhere else, set that exact path in Preferences.

Once configured, BearClaude can seamlessly launch Claude Code sessions, capture conversations into `.specstory/history/`, and keep your specifications tied to actual code changes.
