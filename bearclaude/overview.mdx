BearClaude is a spec-first development tool that helps you think before you code. Instead of jumping straight into implementation, you write clear requirements and specifications in Markdown, then generate intentional code with Claude.

Unlike full AI IDEs that emphasize speed, BearClaude focuses on clarity and intent, keeping your specifications and generated code tightly connected so you never lose the why behind your work. [Read why we built this →](https://bearclaude.specstory.com/mindfulmaking)

At its core, BearClaude provides a three-pane workflow on macOS:

1. Author your specifications, requirements, or task breakdown in Markdown
2. Interact and converse with Claude Code to refine and generate code
3. Save everything into `.specstory/history/` for durable, searchable context

This workflow makes BearClaude ideal for documenting design intent, running agentic coding sessions.
