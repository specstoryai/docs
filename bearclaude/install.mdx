BearClaude is a spec-first macOS app that turns clear Markdown into working software with Claude Code and saves the full reasoning as Markdown alongside your project.

This page gets you from zero to a verified local capture in minutes.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+ on Apple Silicon
- Claude Code installed and available on your PATH
- A local project folder where BearClaude will write to `.specstory/history/`

<Note> BearClaude is **local-first**. Your specs and Claude conversations are saved to your project. Nothing is uploaded unless you later enable syncing with SpecStory Cloud. </Note>

## 1. Download BearClaude

- Visit [bearclaude.specstory.com](https://bearclaude.specstory.com) and download the latest `.dmg` build.
- Double-click the downloaded file and drag **BearClaude.app** into your Applications folder.
- Launch BearClaude from Applications or Spotlight.

<Tip> On first launch, macOS Gatekeeper may ask you to confirm the app came from the internet. Choose **Open**. </Tip>

## 2. Install Claude Code (if you haven’t already)

BearClaude relies on the claude CLI.

```bash
# Prerequisite: Node.js 18+
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify it’s on your PATH
claude --version
```

If claude isn’t found, see: [Configure Claude Code Path →](/bearclaude/claudecode).

<Warning> If your organization manages Node installs or PATH hardening, you may need to ask your admin to expose `claude` to your user shell. </Warning>

## 3. First Launch & Permissions

On first launch, macOS will prompt you to confirm BearClaude as a trusted application:

- Click **Open** when asked to confirm.
- Grant **File System access** when prompted, this is required to save your project’s `.specstory/history/`.

When BearClaude starts:

1. **Choose a project folder:** This is where BearClaude will write .specstory/history/ and keep your specs.
2. **Claude Code path:** BearClaude will try to auto-detect claude. If it can’t, you’ll be prompted to pick the executable manually.
3. **Save location:** Default is `<project>/.specstory/history/`. You can change this in Settings later.

<Note> You can manage all of these later in **BearClaude → Settings**. </Note>

## 4. Verify capture (quick check)

- Create a new Markdown doc (e.g., api-spec.md) and write a short spec (“Create a simple Express route for /health”).
- Click Run with Claude Code (or the run control) to hand off the spec.
- After Claude responds, open your project folder and confirm:

```bash
<your-project>/.specstory/history/
  └─ YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<session>.md
```

You should see a timestamped Markdown session containing your conversation and context.

<Tip> If you don’t see a file right away, try saving the document once or run another short prompt, the first Markdown file is created on save/auto-save. </Tip>

## 4. Verify SpecStory Capture

BearClaude automatically writes every conversation and spec to `.specstory/history/` in your project:

- Create or open a project folder.
- Write a short spec in Markdown and chat with Claude.
- Check your project directory, you should see `.specstory/history/` with Markdown files created.

<Info>
Nothing is uploaded by default. BearClaude is **local-first**, and your `.specstory/history/` remains on your machine unless you explicitly sync it to SpecStory Cloud.
