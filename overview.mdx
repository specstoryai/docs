SpecStory is the **intent layer** for modern software development.
It automatically saves your AI conversations across tools as clean markdown. This preserves the **reasoning**, **decisions**, and **design tradeoffs** behind your code, turning the conversations into **versioned**, **reusable**, **shareable**, and git-friendly knowledge.

## Why SpecStory exists

Software development has shifted from being purely code-centric to **conversation-driven**. The real design happens in iterative discussions with **AI assistants** and **teammates**: evaluating tradeoffs, debugging edge cases, rejecting alternatives, and shaping architecture. But today, those conversations disappear once tools or sessions end. The result: lost context, repeated prompts, and no traceability for teams and organizations.

SpecStory addresses this gap by:
- Capturing developer intent as markdown alongside your code.
- Making reasoning reusable and portable across tools, projects, and time.
- Enabling collaboration and onboarding with shared decision logs.
- Preserving privacy with local-first defaults and explicit sharing.

In short, the most valuable artifact in modern development is not just the code, but the **story behind it**. SpecStory ensures that story is **never lost**.

## What SpecStory does

- **Preserve intent:** Automatically capture AI conversations in Markdown.
- **Make knowledge reusable:** Search, reference, and build on prior problem-solving.
- **Share selectively:** Publish a conversation as a URL when you choose.
- **Derive rules for AI:** Generate and maintain project rules from your previous chats.
- **Stay private:** Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly share or opt in.


## Why developers adopt it

- **Works where you already code:** Cursor, VS Code + Copilot, Claude Code.
- **Git-friendly Markdown:** History lives in your repo alongside code.
- **Frictionless start:** No sign-in required for auto-save and manual save.
- **Future-proof:** Designed to scale from individuals to teams to orgs.


## From Git for Code to Git for Reasoning
Git solved *what changed* in code. SpecStory solves *why it changed*.
